# Busmate
College bus Tracking and management System 
College transportation is one of the most critical daily services relied upon by students. However, in many colleges—including ours—the bus management system is still handled manually. Bus routes and timing updates are written on a chalkboard placed at a common spot in the campus. Since the bus schedule changes almost every day, students gather around the board in large numbers to read the updates, leading to crowding, miscommunication, and unnecessary delays.
To eliminate these recurring issues, our project “BusMate” aims to digitize and streamline the entire bus information process. BusMate is a web-based platform designed specifically to help students access daily bus schedules, route details, timings, and announcements from anywhere, without relying on a physical board. It provides a centralized, clean, and reliable source of information that updates instantly based on the inputs by the transport department.

BusMate is planned to be developed in two phases, ensuring a smooth and realistic growth of the system while keeping the initial version lightweight and easy to deploy. This phased approach helps us focus on solving the most urgent problems first, then gradually expanding into more advanced features.

 Phase 1: Web-Based Bus Schedule & Route Management System.

 Phase 2: GPS-Based Live Tracking (Future Enhancement).
